Category: Arrays and Hashes
Difficulty: Easy

Explanation:
- We want to Look through the "nums" array
- We want to track the numbers that occur (use unordered list)
- Every number we see in "nums" array is added to tracking list
- If we are adding number already in tracking list we have duplicate
    * return false
- If we go through whole array without repeat then no duplicate
    * return true
